I am a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich (Switzerland), working with the [Systems Security Group](https://syssec.ethz.ch/).
I received my Ph.D from the University of California, Irvine (USA) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Gene Tsudik](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gts/) and my Bachelor's degree from Keio University (Japan) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Hiroaki Nishi](http://www.west.sd.keio.ac.jp/in-english).

My current research interest is the intersection of Web security / privacy and Trusted Computing.

Outside of research, I enjoy rock climbing and hanging out with people with a cup of coffee.
