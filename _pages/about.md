I am a 6th year Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine under the supervision of [Dr. Gene Tsudik](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gts/).

I received my Bachelor's degree at Keio University, Japan under the supervision of [Dr. Hiroaki Nishi](http://www.west.sd.keio.ac.jp/in-english).

My current research interest is the intersection of Web security / privacy and Trusted Computing.

Outside of research, I enjoy rock climbing and hanging out with people with a cup of coffee.
